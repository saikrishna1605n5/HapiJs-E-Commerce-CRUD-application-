# A starter project for Hapi.js application

### How to use?

#### Approach - 1
- Add the below configuration in your **.vscode > launch.json** file in the vscode editor before running the app
- If there was no configuration set earlier, just create .vscode folder in the root directory of the folder, add launch.json file and add the below configuration

````javascript
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/index.js",
      "env": {
        "HOST": "localhost",
        "PORT": "3000",
        "MONGODB_URI": "<MONGO_DB_URL>",
        "JWT_SECRET_KEY": "<APP_API_TOKEN>",
        "JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN": "1d"
      }
    }
